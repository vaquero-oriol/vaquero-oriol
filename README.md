# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Oriol Vaquero!

I‚Äôm a passionate developer who has just completed a diploma in Multiplatform Application Development. I am now embarking on a journey to study Computer Engineering, with a focus on Java and backend development.

##  I‚Äôm interested in:

- **Backend Development:** Specializing in Java and Spring Boot, including frameworks like Hibernate, and the development of REST APIs using various patterns and architectures such as MVC and Domain Driven Design.
- **Frontend Development:** Proficient in HTML, CSS, React, Angular for web applications, and React Native and Java(Android Studio)for mobile applications.
- **Learning and Growth:** Beyond formal education, I enjoy working on personal projects to apply and expand my knowledge. This hands-on approach allows me to experiment with various technologies and integrate them into practical, self-developed projects, which not only enriches my learning experience but also benefits my growth as a developer.

##  I‚Äôm currently learning:

- **Angular:** I've noticed that many developers use Angular for the front end when working with Spring Boot, so I decided to learn it on my own. Currently, I'm developing a web application inspired by Notion. My main goal is to create a platform where users can manage their notes and tasks, with features that remind them of upcoming deadlines and help them organize their time effectively.
