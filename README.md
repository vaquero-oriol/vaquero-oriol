# 👋 Hi, I’m Oriol Vaquero!

I’m a passionate developer who has just completed a diploma in Multiplatform Application Development. I am now embarking on a journey to study Computer Engineering, with a focus on Java and backend development.

##  I’m interested in,

- **Backend Development:** Specializing in Java and Spring Boot, including frameworks like Hibernate, and the development of REST APIs using various patterns and architectures such as MVC and Domain Driven Design.
- **Frontend Development:** Proficient in HTML, CSS, React, Angular for web applications, and React Native and Java(Android Studio)for mobile applications.
- **Learning and Growth:** Beyond formal education, I enjoy working on personal projects to apply and expand my knowledge. This hands-on approach allows me to experiment with various technologies and integrate them into practical, self-developed projects, which not only enriches my learning experience but also benefits my growth as a developer.

##  I’m currently learning,

- **Angular:** Enhancing my skills to use it effectively with Spring Boot.
